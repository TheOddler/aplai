INTRODUCTION
------------

Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) is an augmentation of the logic programming paradigm where relations between variables are specified with constraints. It can be seen as an extension that brings relational arithmetic to Prolog.

For the course Avanced Programming Languages in Artificial Intelligence, we are given the opportunity to get real experience with some CLP languages. The goal of this assignment is to get practical experience with different CLP languages and to get a deeper understanding in how they work.

First we will discuss our solver for the popular puzzle game Sudoku. Then we will discuss our approach for solving Shikaku. Followed by a discussion of the extra assignment, to end with a conclusion.

TASK 1: SUDOKU
--------------

### TASK-DESCRIPTION
Sudoku is a puzzle game with a board that consists of a field with N x N blocks consisting of a x N grid. For example there a 3 by 3 blocks here all numbers from 1 to 9 should be filled in without doubles on the same lines in the whole grid.

The classical viewpoint for Sudoku states that all numbers in a row must be different, that all numbers in a column must be different, and that all numbers in a block must be different.

TASK 2: SHIKAKU
---------------

### TASK-DESCRIPTION
Shikaku is a puzzle game where the board consists of a grid with some numbers filled in. To solve the puzzle, you need to transform each number into a square with a surface that equals the number, without overlap, until the whole board is filled.
